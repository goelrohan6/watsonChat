## Synopsis

CareAI is a cognitive chat system which learns from customer care chats, and eventually becomes smart enough to replace humans chatting with customers. It is based on IBM Watson Dialog Service and Chatterbot. With CareAI, you add text-based NLP to your website and get registerations, booking, appoinments, reviews and of course, customer care through Chat AI.

## Motivation

The motivation for this came from witnessing the extreamly inefficient customer care industry there is today.
	We aim to provide a great customer experience.
	Free a lot of human resource from disguised unemployment.
	Present great insights to merchants.
	Get everyone online, and utilize the power of internet and machine learning.

## Usage
1.	To train the AI, go to ``` localhost:3000/chat/human```. 
	When two people (customer side and user side) will be chatting, our app will automaticly analyse the chat on runtime and will be storing occurances.
```	Example : For input A five people give answer X and ten people answer Y our bot will use its intellegence to answer the same question next time another user ask's the same question.

2.	For talking to AI go to ``` localhost:3000/chat/ai ```.
	The AI will automaticly respond to user's question's with its cognitive intellegence.
	

## Installation

```
$ pip install chatbox
$ npm install

```

And point your browser to `http://localhost:3000`. Optionally, specify
a port by supplying the `PORT` env variable.
